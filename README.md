The Minishell project is an essential step in the 42 curriculum that challenges students to create a simplified version of a Unix shell. This project is designed to deepen your understanding of system calls, process management, and command execution in a Unix-like environment. By developing Minishell, you will gain hands-on experience with the fundamental concepts behind shells, such as parsing user input, managing child processes, handling environment variables, and implementing built-in commands.

The goal of Minishell is not just to replicate the basic functionality of a shell, but to also handle edge cases, manage signals, and ensure robust error handling, all while maintaining clean and organized code. This project provides an excellent opportunity to improve your problem-solving skills, as well as your ability to work with low-level programming concepts in C.
